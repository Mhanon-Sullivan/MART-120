      <h1>TMNT: Totally Turtles!</h1>
      <h3>I totally just ripped this out of a Ninja Turtle Little Golden Book I found at Barnes and Noble; enjoy!</h3>
      <h4>"Hi, my name is April O'Niel. I am a news reporter. But there's one story I'm NOT supposed to tell. It's about my friends, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! They are four brothers who watch over me and protect the city, even though they live underground. The sewers are their lair, their dojo, and their home! They didn't always look like mutant turtles. Many years ago, a mysterious ooze called mutagen spilled into the sewers and transformed them all from ordinary turtles... Into heroes in a half shell! Their names are Leonardo: the leader. He keeps his brothers on point with his ninja swords. Raphael: his greatest weapon is his attitude. He's mean and green, and not afraid of anyone or anything! Michelangelo: the only thing he loves more than fighting crime is eating pizza. Finally, Donatello: he's one techy turtle! He's an inventor who makes sure the turtles are always geared up with the greatest gizmos. No matter who or what threatens this city... they will be there. They are my friends! They are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!</h4>
