The main difference between a GUI (graphical user interface) and a CLI (command line interface) is that a GUI is incredibly user friendly. It provides various widgets and menus to make program interation easy for its users. A CLI needs the user to know various commands to get it to do what they want, and it does not use menues or graphics. A CLI uses much less memory and is considerably faster than its GUI counterpart. A CLI also does not require a mouse (only a keyboard), while a GUI requires both.
